## Technical Goals:
- Understanding Basic HTML Structure, CSS formatting to make basic websites
- Introduction to Dreamweaver
- Successfully link pages, building a series of image and text for a viewer to interact with.

## Conceptual Goals:
Take a look at the definition of the word “link.” Consider the definition of a hyperlink (Links to an external site.) as well. The primary definition, as a connecting structure, is the basis for the Internet: a web of connected structures. Links provide people with access to move from structure to structure. Information flows across them.

In the age of the internet, the acts of linking, sharing and re-distributing information are more prevalent than creating completely new content.

Artist Seth Price, in his 2002 artwork and essay Dispersion, argues that “distribution, rather than production, was the primary way in which works accrued meaning, and that artists needed to find ways of harnessing the enormous capacity for meaning-making inherent in communications networks.”

## Tech Specs:
- At least 5 linked HTML pages, containing a mix of image, text, and external hyperlinks.
- Images should be created by the artist (Photoshop, Illustrator, new photographs, GIFs, etc.), or a purposeful use of found images.
- Final website live on GitHub pages.

### More on Mapping:
Think of a map not only as a representation of physical space or layouts, but as a way of linking information together. Think of a map as a way to represent information and ideas in a condensed document. It can be a way to mark connections between different entities.

Part of the role of the artist is to act as a translator – what do you want to tell viewers with your presented information? Are you linking things together to recount a memory, to tell a story, to examine history, or investigate nature? Your artwork does not have to use traditional symbols of land maps, or diagrammatic symbols of charts and graphs, or even text to make points of connection. Visual layering, context, combination, or alterations can all work to make links in art.
