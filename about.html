        <div class="grid-item"><p>I am a third year marketing student, with minors in business analytics and studio art.
            I like to be able to use data to create pieces of art outside of my photography hobby.  Feel free
            to look on my <a href="https://github.com/caroline-eggett" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 128, 192)"><b> Github </b></a> or 
            reach out to my via <a href="mailto:caroline.eggett@gmail.com" target="_blank" style="color:rgb(0, 128, 192)"><b>email</b></a> to schedule a 
            time for a shoot!</p>

            <br> I am a thriving photographer in the state of Ohio. I love to snap photos of people to capture moments 
            of time that drift away endlessly like a lost boat at sea.  I have been doing photography for about a year, 
            but I can assure you that I have experience!  My camera may not be top knotch, but the camera performance is 
            not what makes the picture good... it is the photographer taking the picture. </br>
            
            <br> I love to read and eat chocolate.  I prefer to relax outside in the warm summer weather than be cozy in a 
            blanket in the cold winter.  My favorite times of the year are summer and fall.  I love sunflowers and falling leaves. </br>  
            
            <br> I can do a bunch of types of photography: senior pictures, family portraits, head shots, and whatever special event you 
            have in mind. </br>
            
            <br> As a college student, I hope to bring a new perception to the art of photography.  I have never taken a photography 
            class, but have used trial and error as my teacher.  I am always watching YouTube videos to become the best photographer I can be.  
            I won't try to disappoint in my abilities. </br>
